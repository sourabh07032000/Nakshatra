                <p>Every human being who walks this earth brings with themselves their own set of energies. And each of these energy fields is governed by certain planets and zodiac signs. As a whole different person, the energy field that you entertain ought to be completely different from others. Or to simplify, your energies might not be compatible with others, and this what makes you and any other person you meet, different.</p>

                    <p>Horoscope matching, also known as Kundli matching in Vedic astrology, considers both; the position of the planets at the time of your birth and their current positions to find how compatible two people are for each other. Kundli matching is necessary to find if the position of the planets is likely or unlikely. For example, if Rahu is poised negatively (Rahu Mahadasha) in one’s Rashi, it is not the best time for them to get married. Similarly, the Kundli matching process can help find if the girl or the boy is Mangalik or not? And in case one of them is, your kundli helps in highlighting how one’s Managalik dosha will affect the other person.</p>

                    

                    <p><strong>Kundli Milan - A Friend Or A Foe?</strong></p>

                    <p>However, the world, in recent times, has grown up to develop a very wrong perception about Kundli matching (match making). Couples, especially the ones who dream of a love marriage, find Kundli matching as a hurdle in their relationship. Many of them are scared of the questions that would arise if their kundlis don't match and thus find ways to skip the gun milan ritual. However, this perception of the couples about kundli matching is nothing but merely wrong facts aka half baked knowledge that have been forced into their minds.</p>

                </div>
                <p><strong>How many Gunas must at least match for a successful marriage?</strong></p>
                <p>At least 18 gunas must match for the couple if they wish to witness a long and hurdle-free marriage. However, for couples for whom 18 gunas do not match can too get married, but it is advised that they firstly, must understand that they will have to work very hard in their relationship and secondly, they must talk to astrologer to find how they can make up for the gunas that don’t match.</p><br/>

                <strong>What are the most important parameters in kundli matchmaking?</strong>
                <p>As per our astrologers, Mangal dosha matching and Nandi matching are some of the most important parameters when it comes to kundli matching.</p><br/>

                <p><strong>Can I marry if kundli does not match?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, you can marry if your kundli does not match. However, you must first talk to an astrologer to be well aware of the consequences that come along when you marry despite the horoscope not matching for you. This way, you two will be well aware of things you need to work on to make your relationship work.</p>
