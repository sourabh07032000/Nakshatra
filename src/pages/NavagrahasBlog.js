                  <span class="first">V</span>edic astrology is an ancient
                  Indian practise that uses the positions of the planets and
                  stars to forecast people's futures.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Astrology, which has its roots in the Vedas, a body of holy
                  Hindu books, is still widely used today. In fact, many Hindus
                  will contact an astrologer before embarking on any significant
                  life endeavour or when they are going through a particularly
                  trying time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Along with outlining a person's overall temperament and
                  destiny, a Vedic astrologer will frequently suggest corrective
                  actions that can be taken to lessen the impact of upcoming
                  unfavourable events. These procedures typically centre on
                  practising puja (worship) to a specific planet, among other
                  things.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is crucial to comprehend how the planets are viewed from a
                  Vedic and astrological perspective in order to comprehend why
                  Hindus in the twenty-first century would truly take seriously
                  the idea of worshipping planets in order to improve their
                  life's position.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each specific chapter of our lives is impacted by the planets.
                  be a result of the way they capture and shape life, planets
                  are referred to be grahas.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  Vedic astrology is concerned with nine grahas, collectively
                  known as the navagrahas, where nava is the number nine. Along
                  with the sun (Surya), moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury
                  (Buddha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn
                  (Shani), Rahu (moon's north node), and Ketu (moon's south
                  node), these are the planetary bodies that make up the
                  zodiac.The tiny grahas Rahu and Ketu have no tangible mass.
                  They stand in for the two locations in space where the sun's
                  and moon's orbits converge. Rahu and Ketu are frequently
                  referred to as "shadow planets," and are typically indicative
                  of negative influences, because eclipses block light and take
                  place in relation to the nodes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each graha, according to the Vedas, represents a specific
                  facet of existence and is governed by a different deity. The
                  personalities that underlie the grahas are separate for
                  providing and upholding the various conditions of a person's
                  life.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Spiritual development is the ultimate goal of life. This
                  development is made possible by karma, the Hindu idea that
                  every thought and deed has an equal and opposite reaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the cycle of birth and death, people experience karma over
                  a number of lives and are presented with the lessons they need
                  to learn in order to advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the navagrahas' deities are in charge of teaching us
                  these teachings, they are crucial to facilitating our
                  spiritual development.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  Shukra, for instance, is the one who rules Venus. Venus
                  typically signifies the wife in a man's horoscope, among other
                  things. Consequently, a poorly situated Venus can frequently
                  portend marital issues or even difficulties finding a mate.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  A man may be having trouble finding a companion because,
                  perhaps in a previous life, he took his wife and marriage for
                  granted. The astrologer can advise the male to make some sort
                  of ritual to please Shukra into reducing the negative marital
                  karma after observing a poorly placed Venus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Life is ultimately intended for one's spiritual development,
                  as was previously said. Divinity is not seeking retribution by
                  making it difficult for you to locate a romantic partner. It's
                  to make someone more aware of how valuable a companion like
                  that is.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, one should not consider difficulties to be simply
                  obstacles in the way of hedonistic quest. The deities of the
                  grahas should be regarded as venerated instructors of these
                  lessons, and life's challenges should be understood as
                  opportunities for developing spiritual maturity.
