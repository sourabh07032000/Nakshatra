                        <p><span class="first">L</span>The most significant events that force us to focus on area of change in our lives are Eclipses. We get shocked and unbalanced but it propels us ahead. They awaken us from our profound sleep so that we might all advance from one level of life maturity to another, usually to a higher level of existence.</p>

                        <p>In a typical year, there are four eclipses. Eclipses demand us to alter our behaviour and our methods.</p>
                       
                       
                       <p>Solar and Lunar eclipses occur on full moon and new moon days respectively.  Every five and half month for 18 to 24 months, they emerge in a family of signs that are united on the same axis in the horoscope wheel.</p>

                      <p>In a family of signs they will keep occurring in pairs, coinciding with new moons and full moons. Once a family of sign is finished it will not be back for about seven or eight years.</p>

                     
                      <b>Solar vs Lunar Eclipses</b>

                       <p>When the moon is between the Sun and the earth, it blocks the Sun’s light from reaching the surface of the planet, causing a solar eclipse.</p>
                        
                       <p>When the earth blocks the moon from the Sun, causing the moon to vanish, this is known as a lunar eclipse. Since she only reflects the Sun’s light, the moon doesn’t emit any light of her own. Solar eclipses usually occur on new moons, which symbolizes a fresh start. While a lunar eclipse always occurs on a full moon and typically denotes an end or a climax.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Any eclipse in the skies is a noteworthy occurrence; a solar eclipse actually has the strength of three new moons or full moons, whereas a lunar eclipse actually has the strength of a full moon.</p>
                        
                        
                        <b>Solar eclipses frequently result in fresh starts and exciting new prospects.</b>
                        
                        <p>They frequently deliver news out of the blue, are thrilling, and are frequently quite positive. To determine if an eclipse is entirely friendly or not, we must constantly consider the kinds of discussions the moon or the Sun are having with other planets.</p>
                        
                        <b>Lunar eclipses are particularly upsetting since they usher in final conclusions.</b>
                        
                        <p>They frequently remind us of the passing of time and evoke feeling. A lunar eclipse on a full moon is nearly usually an emotional event. Dreams and memories resurface, and we occasionally experience sentimentality.</p>
